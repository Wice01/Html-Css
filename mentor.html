        <p id = biography> <strong>Elon Reeve Musk</strong> was christened into an Anglican church shortly after his birth on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the main towns of South Africa. Musk has Pennsylvania Dutch and British heritage. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietician who was reared in South Africa after being born in Saskatchewan, Canada. Errol Musk is his father. He is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and real estate entrepreneur who was a joint owner of an emerald mine in Zambia close to Lake Tanganyika. Younger siblings Tosca and Kimbal Musk were also born in 1972. (born 1974).

            When Musk was younger, his family was affluent. His children are said to share their father's distaste for racism, and his father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party. Joshua Haldeman, his maternal grandpa, was a daring American-born Canadian who flew his family to Australia and Africa in a single-engine Bellanca airplane, breaking records in the process. Musk spent the most of his time with his father after his parents' separated in 1980. Due of his growing distance from his father, Musk subsequently came to regret his choice. He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his paternal side.

Ashlee Vance, who wrote Musk's biography, describes Musk as an awkward, reserved youngster. <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Early_life">When Musk was 10, he developed an interest in computing and video games, so he brought a Commodore VIC-20[vague] and taught himself programming from a user manual. At age 12, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.</p></blockquote>
